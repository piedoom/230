Due: Start of class - first day of week 5
Your HTML files must be zipped and handed in to the Study Guide 3 dropbox. This document should be submitted to the dropbox as well, but not zipped. Physical printouts will not be accepted.

Chapter 13 - Boxes
CSS treats each HTML element as if it sits in its own box.

1) If you don’t set the height and width of a box, how big will it be?

It will be the width of the document, and have 0 height


2) Some page designs can expand and shrink to fit the size of the browser window. What are the two CSS properties that can be used to set a minimum and maximum size of a box (element)?

min-width, max-width

Go check out the minimum width example on the book website:
 http://htmlandcssbook.com/code-samples/chapter-13/


3) What CSS properties are used to control the minimum height and maximum height of a box?

min-height, max-height

4) Imagine a paragraph is not big enough to hold its content, write a CSS rule (with a selector) that will hide this extra content.

overflow: hidden;


5) Now write another rule for the same paragraph that will instead cause scroll bars to appear when there is too much content to fit in the paragraph.

overflow: scroll;



6) What are the three properties available to boxes that can be adjusted to control their appearance?

height, width, max-width, background-color, etc.

7) True or False. If you add padding to a 400px box, the box won’t get any bigger. Instead the content area of the box will get smaller.

False


8) True or False. Margins sit outside of a box.

True


9) True or False. Padding goes inside of a box and adds space between the content and the borders of the box.

True


10) Notice how using margin and padding to create white space and vertical margins makes this page:

http://htmlandcssbook.com/code-samples/chapter-13/white-space-vertical-margin.html

look better than this page:

http://htmlandcssbook.com/code-samples/chapter-13/white-space-vertical-margin-no-space.html

	No answer required.


Borders
11) Give the property used to control the width of borders.

border-width


12) List the 8 values for the border-style CSS property.

solid, dotted, dashed, double, groove, ridge, inset, outset


13) Give the property used to control the color of borders.

border-color


Note that the border property can be used as as shorthand for the above 3 properties.

Padding

Note that the bottom box on page 313 has more padding and this makes the text easier to read.


14) For the following shorthand padding declaration, label the left, right, top, and bottom padding:

	padding: 10px 5px 20px 10px;
        top, right, bottom, left



15) “CSS margins collapse” - what does this mean? (page 314)

if there are two elements verical with margin, it will only use one of the biggest
margins



16) Note the trick of centering a box (page 315)

margin-left: auto;
margin-right: auto;


If you want to center text (rather than the entire box), use text-align: center


No answer required.
display

17)  Describe what the following CSS properties do:

display : inline

Makes the element inline (like text)



display: block

Make the element take up its own line


display: inline-block

Makes a block element behave like inline but still be able to use block properties

display: none

don't display the item at all


18) How is visibility: hidden different from display: none?

An invisible item still takes up space.


19) Which CSS property is used to add drop shadows to a box?

box-shadow


20) Which CSS property is used to add rounded corners  to a box, or even to give it an elliptical shape?

border-radius


Look over the “The Analog Specialists” example at: 
http://htmlandcssbook.com/code-samples/chapter-13/example.html#

Be sure to “View Source” to see the HTML and CSS. Note how display:inline has put the navigation links all on one line, and that margin:auto has centered the #page div.

HW


**** HW-3 Part I ****

Give the recipe page’s unordered list of ingredients an elliptical border (something asymmetrical, it doesn’t have to look exactly like this), and a visible drop shadow. See pages 320 and 322 for how to do this. If the text doesn’t fit, that’s OK, we’ll fix it in the next section.



Chapter 14 - Lists, Tables & Forms

CSS for Lists

1) Read over the CSS list pages (331-366) and 


**** HW-3 Part II ****

Change the ingredients list style type to a square
Change the list style position to inside




2) Read over the rest of the chapter (HTML Table and HTML Form CSS)

No answer required.

3) Note the CSS for styling the cursor on page 347. Write a CSS rule that turns the cursor into a question mark (help)

cursor: help;



4) Look over the List, Table and Forms examples at: 
http://htmlandcssbook.com/code-samples/chapter-14/example.html


Be sure to “view source” to see the CSS.

No answer required.





Chapter 15 - Layout

Block-level elements start on their own line and act as the main building blocks of any layout, while inline boxes flow between surrounding text.

If one block-level element sits inside another block level element then the outer box is know as the containing or parent element.

There’s quite a bit to know in this area - we’ll be spending the next 2-3 weeks on this.

Be sure to view the examples (and the source) for this chapter at: 
http://htmlandcssbook.com/code-samples/chapter-15/


Positioning Schemes
1) Normal flow (the default, position:static) each block-level element sits on top of the next one.

No answer required.

2) Relative Positioning (position:relative) moves an element offset to its initial computer


3) Absolute Positioning (position:absolute) causes a box to be positioned absolutely from the documet's top left


4) Fixed Positioning (position:fixed) positions the element in relation to the browser window. When a user scrolls down the page it sticks with it


5) Overlapping elements - when using relative, fixed, or absolute positioning elements can overlap. Which CSS property is used to determine which element is on top?

z-index


6) Floating Elements - the float property allows you to make an element in normal flow and take up 0 height unless the parent element has the property overflow: hidden



7) Which CSS property should be used with float so that it functions consistently?

overflow: hidden



8) Floating allows boxes to site next to each other, but sometimes the results can be strange. clear is sometimes used as as solution. What does clear: left do?

clears all elements to the left side of that element




9) Note the Floated Elements: Problem and Solution. 
Setting the parent element to overflow:auto and width:100% was the solution.



No answer required.


10) Read over the multi-column layout with floats section - easy!


No answer required.




11) Give 2 advantages and 2 disadvantages of using Fixed Width Layouts

- easier to implement
- more consistent

- don't display anywhere else properly
- aren't mobile optimized
- don't do this in 2016



12) Give 2 advantages and 2 disadvantages of using Liquid Layouts.

- should display well in any view
- modern tools make developing them easy

- edge circumstances may make layouts more difficult
- can stifle creativity when focusing on responsive design


13) Be sure to check out the Fixed Layout and Liquid Layout examples in the book and on the Web Site.
	No answer required.


14) Designers commonly use a 960-pixel wide layout with 12 columns (60 pixels wide, 10 pixel margins). This 960 pixel grid allows a multitude of column layouts, which you can see on pages 389-390.


	No answer required.


15) Look over @import and the <link> tag and understand what they do.

	No answer required.

16) Finally, look over the final  chapter example, which uses 960.gs

	No answer required.
