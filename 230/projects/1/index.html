    <h1>How to Use</h1>    
    <p>
      Move your mouse around in the red area above to draw spirograph-like circles.
      Press the left bracket key "{" in order to make the circles smaller, and 
      the right bracket key "}" in order to make the circles larger.  Press the
      "reset" button to clear the canvas, and the "save" button to save the image
      to a file.
    </p>

    <h1>Known Problems</h1>
    <p>
      When the canvas or window is resized, it will clear all of the artwork.
    </p>

    <h1>How does it work?</h1>
    <p>
      I used mainly plain javascript and the Canvas API in order to create a very
      simplistic drawing application.  First, the program finds the canvas in the
      DOM.  Next, the program sets up handlers to take care of actions like moving
      the mouse.  When the mouse is moved in the canvas, a 360 degree arc (circle)
      is drawn with a variable radius.<br><br>
      The document is saved by getting the image in the canvas and saving it as data.
      It is automatically saved by opening that data in the browser.  The clear
      button works by drawing a clear rectagle over everything.
