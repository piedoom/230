    <h1>About This Project</h1>    
    <p>
      I chose this project because I have not used canvas in the past, and I thought
      it would be useful and fun.  I also didn't know that much plain javascript.

    <h1>How I Went Above</h1>
    <p>
      I think I went above and beyond by learning a new technology by myself and
      successfully implementing it in a page.  I also think the "save" feature
      is pretty neat, even if it was just some copy and pasting.  I also think
      I did a good job on the design of the site, and the HTML/CSS is very clean.
      The whole site is pretty responsive too, and I did version control with
      git and uploaded everything to Github.
    </p>

    <h1>How I Could Have Improved</h1>
    <p>
      I could have made the drawing application draw circles in-between mouse points.
      Sometimes the mouse travels too quickly for the circles to draw smoothly, so
      that could have been cool.  I also could have implemented a way to change colors.
